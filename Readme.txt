Program Description:
Hlsyn takes in three arguments, the input circuit file, the required latency for scheduling, and the name of the output file. Hlsyn converts the circuit file to a verilog state machine, and schedules the operations according to the force directed scheduling algorithm. The program then outputs the scheduled verilog state machine to the output file.
