Program Description:
Dpgen takes in two arguments, the input circuit file and the name of the
output file. Dpgen then converts the input file to synthesizable verilog
code. Then the program determines the critical path of the circuit which 
is defined as the largest delay between either an input to a REG 
component, or a REG-REG component.
